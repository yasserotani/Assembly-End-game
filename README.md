# 🧠 Assembly: Endgame

A fun little React word-guessing game I built as part of the [Scrimba Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

In this game, your goal is to guess a randomly chosen programming-related word, letter by letter. But there's a twist: you only have 8 chances — one for every programming language except Assembly. Mess up too many times, and you're forced to code in Assembly forever 😅

---

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Click the letters to guess the word.
- For each wrong guess, you lose a programming language.
- If you lose all 8... you lose!
- Guess all the letters correctly to win and trigger a confetti celebration 🎉

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me practice and apply many concepts I learned during the **Scrimba Learn React course**, including:

- ✅ React components & props
- ✅ `useState` and managing local state
- ✅ Conditional rendering
- ✅ JSX and rendering lists
- ✅ Dynamic styling with class names
- ✅ Accessibility basics (`aria-live`, screen-reader support)
- ✅ Creating reusable utility functions
- ✅ Working with arrays and strings in JavaScript
- ✅ Using third-party components (`react-confetti`)
- ✅ Organizing code into modules (`utils.js`, `languages.js`)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (via Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- `clsx` for dynamic class names
- `react-confetti` for win animation
