# 🧠 Assembly: Endgame
A mini game where the player guesses a word letter by letter.
The player has a limited number of attempts (based on the number of programming languages) and receives visual feedback for correct and incorrect guesses.

This project was originally built while following the Scrimba Learn React course, with some additional features and refinements added beyond the course content.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Click the letters to guess the word.
- For each wrong guess, you lose a programming language.
- If you lose all 8... you lose!
- Guess all the letters correctly to win and trigger a confetti celebration 🎉

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me practice and apply many concepts I learned during the **Scrimba Learn React course**, including:

- ✅ React components & props
- ✅ `useState` and managing local state
- ✅ Conditional rendering
- ✅ JSX and rendering lists
- ✅ Dynamic styling with class names
- ✅ Accessibility basics (`aria-live`, screen-reader support)
- ✅ Creating reusable utility functions
- ✅ Working with arrays and strings in JavaScript
- ✅ Using third-party components (`react-confetti`)
- ✅ Organizing code into modules (`utils.js`, `languages.js`)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React (via Vite)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS
- `clsx` for dynamic class names
- `react-confetti` for win animation
